# Advent of Code 2019

My attempts to solve the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019), trying to get better at Python.

Still to solve:

* Day 14: I have an apparently working solution for Part 1 that works fine for all example BUT ONE :-( (and of course not for the input)
* Day 17 Part 2: I tried to solve "by hand" the inputs for Part 2 (would need a compression algorithm), they look ok but the output is wrong
* Day 18: Again a maze! Looks fun and interesting, but for now I knwo tto little of maze solving algorithm to attempt this...
8 Day 19: Part 1 looked simple enough, but my intcode computer does not seem to respond well :-(
